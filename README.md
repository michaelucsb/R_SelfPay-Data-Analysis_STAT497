## PROJECT SUMMARY
The project set out to conduct data exploration and analysis to identify if there is any useful variable available within hospitals' patient accounting system to offer insight as to whether a self-pay patient will pay his/her outstanding bills.  The data was extracted from a commercial demo site, and it has been encrypted to compliant with the privacy laws.

In the data analysis, the project conducted various analyses on individual variables against the two response variables - "Current Outstanding Balance", which is numeric, and "Whether Paid in Full", which is factor yes/no.  In the end, we delivered some recommendation based on the findings.
